# Arduino-RGB-and-Keyes009-LED-Test
This sketch can be use to test RGB LEDS to confirm they operate correctly. The sketch firsts test that each color can be dimmed and brightened smoothly (some Keys 009 boards would not do this for all LEDS), then the colour mixing ability. My blog at  https://rydepier.wordpress.com/2015/07/02/ky009-three-colour-led/ shows how to make a very efective, but simple diffuser to improve colour mixing.
